&gt; TLDR(◊ê◊û;◊ú◊ß) ‚Äì Great potential; deploy microservices and API‚Äôs to a great number of serverless services (lambda;google func etc), but far from perfect.</p>

<p>Age of the serverless ‚Äì stop configure and ‚Äúautoscale‚Äù manually every little service.</p>

<p>I like this mindset; as a devoted user of firebase with nodejsbased functions and an ex-Google app engine with Django rest.</p>

<p>Using a platform SDK to deploy your own code could get addictive. There is something so satisfied deploying your own code to Firebase functions using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-tools">firebase-cli</a> or to Google functions with their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/">cloud SDK</a>.</p>

<p>The main problem with all of these beautiful serverless services is that you‚Äôre pretty much locking yourself inside of a very specific realm.</p>

<p>Imagine having a tool like <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, but instead of creating a stack based on regular instances or even docker swarm of containers having a framework that can actually deploy your serverless service regardless of what managed platform you wanna use.</p>

<h1 id="introducing-the-serverless-framework">Introducing: the serverless framework</h1>

<p>Recently it became a hot topic ‚Äì as a great solution to deploy a service without binding yourself to just one service.</p>

<p>As much as it‚Äôs a brilliant idea; the implementation so far is far from great ‚Äì in fact it feels like yet another not fully baked framework that trying to solve a need by just hacking around.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs dive into what I‚Äôm referring to as an unbacked service:</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say I want to deploy my demo API to Google Functions:</p>

<h2 id="unbacked-1">Unbacked #1</h2>

<p>I still have to include in my project <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-google-cloudfunctions">serverless-google-cloudfunctions</a> npm package ‚Äì what‚Äôs the point of trying to create a generic approach to all serverless services if I still have to use a specific service package.</p>

<h2 id="unbacked-2">Unbacked #2</h2>

<p>In the serverless.yml conf file; we have to specify the current provider and a plugin that we use for this provider</p>

<p>The worst part is that we need to map the handlers(which is exactly like when using cloud sdk).</p>

<h2 id="example-for-a-serverless-yml-file">Example for a serverless.yml file:</h2>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">service: demo-api

provider:
name: google
runtime: nodejs
project: test-evilurge
credentials: ~/.gcloud/keyfile.json

plugins:
- serverless-google-cloudfunctions
package:
exclude:
- node_modules/**
- .gitignore
- .git/**
PY
functions:
status:
handler: status
events:
  - http: path

test2:
handler: test2
events:
- http: path
</code></pre>

<h2 id="unbacked-3">Unbacked #3</h2>

<p>Where is Firebase?</p>

<p>Or better yet; where is the community?</p>

<p>Of course, it‚Äôs an ‚Äúopensource‚Äù service(not fully; ex having a dashboard is part of the paid subscription), meaning I can commit support for  Firebase func integration.</p>

<p>But it feels like with the need to add ‚Äúplugins‚Äù and having a manifest yml file that specify paths, there‚Äôs no real advantage using serverless YET.</p>

<p>BTW; just for the heck of it</p>

<p>in firebase, it‚Äôs enough that I‚Äôm having their server if I‚Äôm not on dev env, and firebase will register all of my routes(unlike in serverless)</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const server = express();


server.use(bodyParser.json());
server.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}));

require('./conf/urls').urls(server);

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'DEV') {
let port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
server.listen(port);
console.log('Server is running on port %s', port)
} else {
module.exports = {api: require('firebase-functions').https.onRequest(server)};
}
</code></pre>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>There is a great need to have this kindof framework that will make the work of deploying to those serverless service as more strip and generic as possible.</p>

<p>But as long as we gonna keep using a menifest yaml per project and having to include the service package within our build, there is no real advantage going on.</p>

<p>For the time being, serverless is simply an unbacked idea; Though ill be happy to get back to it one of these days when things will get a bit more simplified.</p>
