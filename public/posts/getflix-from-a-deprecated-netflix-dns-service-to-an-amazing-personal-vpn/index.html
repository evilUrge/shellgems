Almost a year ago, Netflix announced a worldwide support. As a movie junky that owned a US Netflix account, it was super exciting news! no more hiding behind DNS and VPN services to fake my IP.</p>

<p>Well, soon enough the thrill ended when I realized that the content in my region is pretty much empty. Netflix rushed to release new regions without trying to first get licenses for new content.</p>

<p>But that‚Äôs not what this post is about.</p>

<p>back than I‚Äôve used a great service called ‚ÄúGetflix‚Äù.</p>

<p>It supported US and western Europe Netflix regions. actually, it was so great I hurried to purchase a lifetime subscription (It was on too-good-to-be-true discount).</p>

<p>Shortly after my purchase, Netflix started the war on VPN\DNS.</p>

<p>Since then, I‚Äôve canceled my Netflix account(after almost 5 years subscription). The thing is that I was stuck with a deprecated DNS service.</p>

<p>Apparently, Getflix is offering to all of their users a <a href="https://www.getflix.com.au/manage/vpn">VPN service</a> with <a href="https://getflix.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/204476204">92 different</a> locations!</p>

<p>So I‚Äôve configured my Xiaomi MiWiFi router to pass all of my laptop + my gf laptop traffic trough one of their locations.</p>
