      <description>From the 28 of February you can have your own .dev domain.
 I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it short. Google started with the early access program for the .dev tld.
From the 28 of February(3 days) you could buy you own.dev domain for ~12$!
Some useful links  tld-list - Compare prices of different registrars. porkbun or namecheap - dev friendly registrar.  Oh and I almost forgot to write about this new blog; Hugo based static page blog that being served in Firebase üéî instead of a heavy Wordpress with a dedicated vm.</description>

      <title>Puppeteer &#43; Firebase = Test headless in the cloud</title>

      <description>A couple of months ago, I had the opportunity to experiment a bit with Google‚Äôs latest competitor for Cypress, Puppeteer.
Just like Cypress, Puppeteer is a node module that includes a headless version of Chrome and a wrapper-controller (similar to Selenium‚Äôs webdriver).
One of the key differences between the two is the fact that Puppeteer is purely opensource with no additional dashboards or nice fancy UI‚Äôs that costs the user extra.</description>

      <description>Update #1 08.10.18 ‚Äì Forgot about all I just said; here is an amazing simple way When you‚Äôre working with Google product, you need to get used to Google paste.
Recently google published a blog article explaining a little better of how to use their firebase deploy commend for CI purposes
I took the liberty to create a deployment script based on that post: ci-firebase-deploy-script
and included a dockerfile based on alpine slim image.</description>

      <title>Serverless Framework</title>

      <description>TLDR(◊ê◊û;◊ú◊ß) ‚Äì Great potential; deploy microservices and API‚Äôs to a great number of serverless services (lambda;google func etc), but far from perfect.
 Age of the serverless ‚Äì stop configure and ‚Äúautoscale‚Äù manually every little service.
I like this mindset; as a devoted user of firebase with nodejsbased functions and an ex-Google app engine with Django rest.
Using a platform SDK to deploy your own code could get addictive.</description>

      <title>What all small cloud platforms truly missing? (and how am I gonna face that)</title>

      <description>Not all of us need to use one of the a huge cloud platform as AWS and GCP. but recently after working on a migration project that required me to transfer everything to DigitalOcean, I noticed something that is truly missing.
I‚Äôm not talking about a managed services such as: RDS\Cloudsql, ELB with Autosacle, AppEngine, ECP or anything else that makes these huge providers covered so many services
 Full disclosure: today I enrolled to DigitalOcean early access for a container orchestration based on Kubernetes.</description>

      <title>Goodbye Freelance Life</title>

      <description>For years I used to work as a regular employee in startup companies(and one huge corporation R.I.P.).
In Israel, there is this trend of going on long trips right after the military mandatory service. Unfortunately, I skipped that and dived right into the IT industry with believing that I‚Äôll redeem this dream of traveling around one day. At least when I‚Äôll feel comfortable enough in my field.
Basing a dream on a general feeling secure in the software industry is really hard.</description>

      <title>Firebase Functions and Python</title>

      <description>Update #2: It‚Äôs official ‚Äì beta: As part of Google Cloud Platform, you can now use Python 3.7 runtime for Django or Flask based webapps!
Guess that it‚Äôs not yet implemented in Firebase, but as Firebase it‚Äôs just a nicer wrapper for an existing service, then it‚Äôs purely just a matter of time.
Thanks Google üôã
Update #1: Ho-ly shit; It happened. A ‚Äúcompiler‚Äù for flask and Django based python apps.</description>

      <title>Getflix From a Deprecated Netflix Dns Service to an Amazing Personal VPN</title>

      <description>Almost a year ago, Netflix announced a worldwide support. As a movie junky that owned a US Netflix account, it was super exciting news! no more hiding behind DNS and VPN services to fake my IP.
Well, soon enough the thrill ended when I realized that the content in my region is pretty much empty. Netflix rushed to release new regions without trying to first get licenses for new content.</description>

      <title>Socks Proxy From Everywhere in the World</title>

      <description>Ever wonder if you can use your raspberry pi/ec2/any kind of ssh instance as a proxy?
I had the same kind of thought as part of my awesome times with my old raspberry, and I‚Äôve found a simple method to make any ssh server into a sock proxy.
We‚Äôll start by running the following command:
ssh -D 3213 -C -N user@host.com -p 22  little argument explanation:
D ‚Äì Port the sock proxy going to bind in the localhost C ‚Äì Compresses the data before sending it (pretty cool if you ask me) N- Create a ‚Äòsilent session‚Äô, where nothing is being sent nor receive(great for this usage).</description>
