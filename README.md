My personal blog + a deploy script (and pipeline) via circleCI

Latest build: [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/evilUrge/shellgems.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/evilUrge/shellgems)

## DAFUQ going on here
My blog is based on Hugo static page generator -> hence all the posts and pages are in markdown format.

#### This repoestory includes:
* All my pages (in MD).
* A slightly modified theme ([hugo-terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal)).
* Firebase deploy script _deploy.js_.
* CircleCI definition yaml.
