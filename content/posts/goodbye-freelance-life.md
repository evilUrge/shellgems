![Goodbye Freelance](/img/goodbye.png)

> TLDR(אמ;לק) – After 5 years of freelancing, I'm moving to a full-time job.

I've been a freelance developer for the past 5 years. It's been an amazing journey, filled with ups and downs, but ultimately very rewarding. I've worked with clients from all over the world, on projects ranging from small websites to large-scale applications.

But now, I'm moving on to a full-time job. It's a bittersweet moment, but I'm excited about the new chapter in my life.

Here's what I've learned from my freelance experience:

1. **Time Management is Key**
   - You need to be able to manage your time effectively
   - Set clear boundaries between work and personal life
   - Learn to say no to projects that don't align with your goals

2. **Client Communication is Crucial**
   - Be clear and upfront about your expectations
   - Keep clients updated on project progress
   - Handle difficult situations professionally

3. **Financial Planning is Essential**
   - Save for rainy days
   - Plan for slow periods
   - Invest in your business

4. **Continuous Learning is Important**
   - Stay up to date with new technologies
   - Learn from your mistakes
   - Network with other developers

5. **Work-Life Balance is Possible**
   - Set your own schedule
   - Take breaks when needed
   - Make time for family and friends

I'm grateful for all the opportunities I've had as a freelancer, and I'm looking forward to the new challenges that await me in my new role.

Thank you to all my clients, colleagues, and friends who have supported me along the way. I couldn't have done it without you.
