description: I finally built my own mini ITX gaming PC and it's brilliant!
---
COVID kept a lot of us indoor, luckily cloud gaming service got stronger with time Especially here in the Netherlands.
It actually helped me survive the first lockdown; and kind of drugged me back to my childhood

Got myself a cheap single board computer and used it to stream GeForce now and Stadia and ease.

Which got me thinking; what if I'll build my own gaming PC just like when I was a kid?
The real motivation was because I really wanted to play Fallout New Vegas and mod it, so it would like a bit newer and modern graphics and gameplay wise.

Okay from where to start? Form factor yes!
I was locked down with Playstation since Playstation 2, therefore I got used to the small form factor
