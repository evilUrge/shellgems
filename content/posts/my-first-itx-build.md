COVID kept a lot of us indoor, luckily cloud gaming service got stronger with time Especially here in the Netherlands.
It actually helped me survive the first lockdown; and kind of drugged me back to my childhood.

Got myself a cheap single board computer and used it to stream GeForce now and Stadia and ease.

Which got me thinking; what if I'll build my own gaming PC just like when I was a kid?
The real motivation was because I really wanted to play Fallout New Vegas and mod it, so it would like a bit newer and modern graphics and gameplay wise.

Okay from where to start? Form factor yes!
I was locked down with Playstation since Playstation 2, therefore I got used to the small form factor.

## The Build Process

After months of research and waiting for parts (thanks to the chip shortage), I finally assembled my dream ITX build:

### Specs
- Case: Lian Li TU150
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X
- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti
- RAM: 32GB Corsair Vengeance LPX
- Storage: 1TB Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVMe
- PSU: Corsair SF750 Platinum
- Motherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX B550-I Gaming

### The Experience

Building in an ITX case was both challenging and rewarding. The limited space required careful cable management and component placement. The Lian Li TU150 was a great choice - it's compact but still offers good airflow and build quality.

The most nerve-wracking part was installing the CPU cooler. With limited space, I had to be extra careful not to damage any components. The stock AMD cooler actually fit perfectly, though I might upgrade to a low-profile aftermarket cooler in the future.

### Performance

The build exceeded my expectations. It handles modern games at 1440p with ease, and the 5600X + 3060 Ti combination is perfect for my needs. The system stays surprisingly cool despite the compact form factor.

### Modding Fallout New Vegas

Now I can finally play Fallout New Vegas with all the mods I wanted! The game looks and plays like a modern title with the right mods installed. The RTX 3060 Ti handles the enhanced graphics without breaking a sweat.

## Tips for First-Time ITX Builders

1. Plan your build carefully - measure everything twice
2. Consider power supply wattage carefully - you need enough but not too much
3. Cable management is crucial in small cases
4. Don't forget about cooling - airflow is important even in small cases
5. Take your time - rushing can lead to mistakes

## Conclusion

Building an ITX PC was a great experience that brought back memories of my first PC builds. The compact form factor is perfect for my needs, and the performance is excellent. If you're considering building an ITX system, go for it - just do your research and take your time!
